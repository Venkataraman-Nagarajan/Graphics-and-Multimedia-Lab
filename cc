It was an interesting experience interviewing with them. 
All questions were interesting, classical and also had a 
hidden detail left to be uncovered 
of it, Being a problem-solving-enthusiast,
It was exciting to uncover and arrive at a solution with 
the interviewer. 
The interviewers were very friendly and kind, made me feel 
comfortable throughout the whole process.
The overall experience was good and memorable.
